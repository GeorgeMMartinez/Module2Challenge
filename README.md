In this assignment I created a portfolio with my name, image, and sections containing info about me, projects I have done, and how to contact me.
I made sure the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When my projects are clicked, it deploys to a webpage containing my projects.

Sorry I didn't get to complete the assignment a family issue came up.
